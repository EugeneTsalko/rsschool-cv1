## About me
For seven years I worked in an outsourcing accounting company: started as an ordinary accountant and grew to a deputy head. In my opinion, I reached the ceiling in this profession, it was not interesting for me to develop further in it and I decided to change the field of activity to something more progressive.

My goal is to become a JS/FE developer in demand. My core strengths are efficiency, stress resistance, attention to details, deadlines, learning.
